# EIE3109_catAsm
# This app is a pet cat generator, and the goal is to generate over 100 cats to upgrade them to King Cats.  The app is capable of generating and removing bitmaps with a 'meow' sound effect when users tap on the empty space or on the bitmaps displayed on the screen.  The bitmaps move at random speeds and bounce off the borders of the screen. When the user taps the empty space on the screen to create cats, a toast message will be displayed saying 'Petted X times,' and the bitmap will change to Christmas style cats every 10 times. When the user taps the bitmap cats on the screen to remove them, a toast message will be displayed saying 'Removed X Cats' every 10 times, and the bitmap will reset to normal if the cats are in Christmas style. If the user taps the empty space on the screen to create cats over 100 times, a toast message will be displayed saying 'Long Live the KING CATs,' and the bitmap will change to king style cats. This is the ultimate goal of the app.
